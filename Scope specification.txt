Motor data files:
Brand, motor model, kv
Propeller size, prop pitch


Battery data file:
Brand, capacity, weight, discharge rate
....


ESC data file:
Brand, current limit, weight

Existing questions:
Weight of vehicle - possibly going to correlate frame weight to payload/flight time. This may not be the best way.
How to incorporate payload running requirement (30 min), was thinking about trendlines on the data point to show payload run time.

Order of operations:

For each motor/prop combination-
	- interpolate thrust vs throttle data to get corresponding function
	- iterpolate thrust vs current data
	- for each battery/ESC combo
		- calculate total vehicle weight (payload (fixed), frame (fixed), motors, battery(s), ESCs, other components)
		- calculate hover throttle (from thrust vs throttle)
		- calculate hover current draw (from thrust/throttle vs current)
		- calculate flight time (80% of battery)
